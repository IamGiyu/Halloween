     <p><h3><u>What Halloween means?</u></h3>
        The word "Halloween" comes from All Hallows' Eve and<br>
         means "hallowed evening." Hundreds of years ago, people<br>
         dressed up as saints and went door-to-door, which is the origin of<br> 
         Halloween costumes and trick-or-treating.<br>
         <h3><u>How did Halloween start and why?</u></h3>
         The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain,<br>
         when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. <br>
          Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, <br>
         carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning costumes and eating treats.
         <h3><u>Who celebrates Halloween?</u></h3></p>
            Although it's derived from ancient festivals and religious rituals, <br>
            Halloween is still widely celebrated today in a number of countries <br>
            around the globe. In countries such as Ireland, Canada and the United States,<br>
            traditions include costume parties, trick-or-treating, pranks and games.
            <h3><u>Why do we say trick or treat?</u></h3>
            Children of all ages dress up in costumes and travel<br>
            from house to house to receive treats in response to<br>
            their call of “trick or treat!" The phrase is a subtle<br>
            suggestion that if a treat (like candy) is given, then<br>
            the child will not perform a “trick" (mischief) on the owner of the house.</p>
